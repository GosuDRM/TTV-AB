## 🚀 Usage

1. Install the extension from your browser's add-on store
2. Navigate to [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) and open any live stream or VOD
3. Ads are blocked automatically — no configuration needed
4. Click the extension icon to view stats or toggle Ad Blocking, Ad Spoofing, and Low Quality Fallback
5. Change language via the dropdown in the popup footer

## ⚙️ How It Works

TTV AB intercepts Twitch's HLS video playlists at the network level. When Twitch injects ad-marked segments or forces the player onto an ad-only path, the extension:

- Strips ad segments from M3U8 media playlists in real time
- Fetches clean backup streams using alternative player types when the native stream is ad-locked
- Serves a valid empty video segment in place of blocked ad content to keep the decoder stable
- Monitors playback health and automatically recovers from stalls after ad breaks
- Restores your original quality and volume settings once native playback resumes

When a channel opens during an ad — or an ad starts mid-stream — the extension switches to a clean backup stream within a couple of seconds so video starts playing right away. The backup targets the quality your connection has been sustaining — even if the player had just restarted on a low rung when the ad hit — with a 360p floor so a channel-open preroll (the player is still ramping up from its lowest quality at that point) never starts blurrier than 360p. Your full native quality and audio are restored automatically and seamlessly once the ad window ends. The optional **Low Quality Fallback** toggle trades some quality for an even faster first frame, starting on a quick low-resolution stream and climbing back up as the break ends.

## 🔔 What's New

### v9.9.5 — 2026-06-12
- **Channel cards with real watch time.** Tap any channel in Top Channels for an animated card showing ads blocked, tracked watch time, time saved, ad breaks survived, your block share, first/last block dates, and a one-click Visit Channel button — all stored locally, nothing uploaded.

### v9.9.4 — 2026-06-12
- **One-click debug logs for bug reports.** "Report a bug." now asks if you want a TTV AB log file first — it captures the extension's own console lines from your open Twitch tabs into a downloadable text file (all local, nothing uploaded), then takes you to GitHub Issues.

### v9.9.3 — 2026-06-12
- **Live ads-blocked badge.** The toolbar icon now wears a red counter showing how many ads you've blocked, compacted to stay readable (1.5K, 1M, 1B) and ticking up in real time.

_See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the complete list of changes._

## 🛠️ Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GosuDRM/TTV-AB.git
cd TTV-AB
npm install
npm run build          # compiles TypeScript, minifies, and bundles
npm run package:chrome # creates Chrome Web Store upload archive
npm run lint           # runs Biome linter
npm run knip           # checks for unused exports
```

The build outputs to `dist/`. Load the unpacked extension from `dist/manifest.json` in your browser's developer mode after building.

The source tree under `src/` is organized by concern — `modules/` for core ad-blocking logic (processor, parser, player, hooks, worker, state, API), `scripts/` for the bridge and background service worker, and `popup/` for the extension UI.

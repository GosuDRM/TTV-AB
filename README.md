## Usage

1. Navigate to [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv)

3. Ads will be automatically blocked
4. Click the extension icon and use the toggle to enable/disable
5. Change language via the dropdown in the footer

## How It Works

The extension intercepts Twitch's live and VOD HLS video playlists and:
- Strips ad-marked segments from M3U8 playlists when Twitch injects them
- Fetches backup ad-free streams when Twitch forces playback onto an ad path
- Collapses player-side display-ad shells and overlay banners
- Suppresses injected direct video ads on VOD pages and returns playback to the real archive stream
- Caches known ad segments to reduce repeated playback disruption

During active ad recovery, Twitch may temporarily fall back to a lower-quality backup stream, such as `360p`, while the extension keeps playback alive. Once the ad window ends and the player returns to native playback, your chosen quality is restored.

## What's New

### v6.1.0
- **React-Safe Display-Ad Cleanup** - Post-ad cleanup now hides and resets Twitch-managed display-ad nodes instead of removing them from the DOM, preventing Twitch's React teardown from crashing the player into the big `?` placeholder during live and VOD navigation.
- **SDA Teardown Compatibility** - Stale display-ad shell cleanup now leaves Twitch-owned nodes attached under `#root` until Twitch unmounts them itself, avoiding `SDAContextManager` `Node.removeChild` exceptions after ad recovery.

### v6.0.9
- **Console Log Noise** - Silenced the repetitive `Fetch intercepted exception: NetworkError` logs that could flood the browser console during certain network conditions.
- **Debug Logging** - Updated the global logger to suppress all `debug` level messages by default.

### v6.0.7
- **Post-Ad Native 360p Lock** - Ad recovery no longer explicitly rewrites the native `PlaybackAccessToken` to `autoplay` during the recovery window, fixing the bug where the player's resolution menu locked down to 360p indefinitely after an ad block.
- **Pre-roll Recovery Loops** - Implemented background simulated ad-impression tracking by headless fetching of blocked ad segments. This actively clears Twitch's backend pre-roll state, putting an end to infinite looping reload cycles.

### v6.0.6
- **Broader Stitched Ad Detection** - The worker now catches more Twitch stitched ad variants before they fall through to native playback, improving ad-break interception on recent stream-side changes.
- **Turbo Break Overlay Cleanup Hardening** - Full-page Twitch Turbo / ad-break promo surfaces are now recognized more reliably and repeated cleanup of the same overlay is deduped so DOM cleanup counters stop climbing on the same page.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full version history.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run package:chrome
npm run lint
npm run knip
```

Load the unpacked extension from `dist/manifest.json` after `npm run build`.
Create a Chrome Web Store upload archive with `npm run package:chrome`; it writes `ttv-ab-<version>-chrome-store.zip` at the repo root.

`npm run knip` is expected to pass cleanly with the current `knip` 6.1.1 configuration.

## Usage

1. Install the extension from your browser's add-on store
2. Navigate to [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) and open any live stream or VOD
3. Ads are blocked automatically — no configuration needed
4. Click the extension icon to view stats, toggle ad blocking on/off, or toggle the Buffer Fix
5. Change language via the dropdown in the popup footer

## How It Works

TTV AB intercepts Twitch's HLS video playlists at the network level. When Twitch injects ad-marked segments or forces the player onto an ad-only path, the extension:

- Strips ad segments from M3U8 media playlists in real time
- Fetches clean backup streams using alternative player types when the native stream is ad-locked
- Serves a valid empty video segment in place of blocked ad content to keep the decoder stable
- Monitors playback health and automatically recovers from stalls after ad breaks
- Restores your original quality and volume settings once native playback resumes

During ad recovery, Twitch may briefly serve a lower-quality backup stream (e.g. 360p) while the extension keeps playback alive. Your chosen quality is restored automatically once the ad window ends.

## What's New

### v7.6.2
- Ad recovery properly refreshes access token to escape ad window

### v7.6.0
- Audio no longer desyncs after ad recovery

### v7.5.9
- Removed rapid pause and resume cycling during consecutive midroll breaks

### v7.5.8
- Broader ad marker detection added

### v7.5.7
- Ad blocking stays active when ads are embedded in the stream — switches to a clean backup immediately

### v7.5.6
- Stream no longer shows as offline after ads end
- Playback no longer stalls after ad tracking strips all segments
- Ads no longer leak through during marker bounce
- Backup stream no longer cycles rapidly during consecutive midrolls
- Inline ad stripping removed — every break uses a clean backup stream

### v7.4.1
- Channel no longer shows falsely offline when an ad break ends on an empty playlist

### v7.4.0
- First ad no longer causes a buffer gap — backup search runs without blocking playback
- Duplicate backup searches prevented for the same break
- Live-only ad segments now handled inline without switching streams

### v7.3.3
- Backup variant URLs reset between breaks to prevent stale matches

### v7.3.2
- Autoplay stays as fallback instead of getting locked in as the preferred backup type

### v7.3.1
- Player reloads are suppressed during rapid consecutive midrolls, stopping ad leaks

### v7.3.0
- Backup player cycling is smarter — when a backup type keeps returning ad-marked streams, it gets tried less often, reducing unnecessary token fetches. Autoplay (360p) stays as a reliable last resort when other options are exhausted
- Ad break recovery is more stable on channels where every backup type comes back contaminated

### v7.2.1
- Back-to-back midroll ads no longer leak through after recovery
- Playback properly recovers when a backup stream was used during an ad break
- Memory usage stays stable with automatic cache cleanup
- Buffer gaps are now skipped smoothly

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GosuDRM/TTV-AB.git
cd TTV-AB
npm install
npm run build          # compiles TypeScript, minifies, and bundles
npm run package:chrome # creates Chrome Web Store upload archive
npm run lint           # runs Biome linter
npm run knip           # checks for unused exports
```

The build outputs to `dist/`. Load the unpacked extension from `dist/manifest.json` in your browser's developer mode after building.

The source tree under `src/` is organized by concern — `modules/` for core ad-blocking logic (processor, parser, player, hooks, worker, state, API), `scripts/` for the bridge and background service worker, and `popup/` for the extension UI.

## Usage

1. Navigate to [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv)
2. Open any live stream or VOD
3. Ads will be automatically blocked
4. Click the extension icon and use the toggle to enable/disable
5. Change language via the dropdown in the footer

## How It Works

The extension intercepts Twitch's live and VOD HLS video playlists and:
- Strips ad-marked segments from M3U8 playlists when Twitch injects them
- Fetches backup ad-free streams when Twitch forces playback onto an ad path
- Collapses player-side display-ad shells and overlay banners
- Suppresses injected direct video ads on VOD pages and returns playback to the real archive stream
- Caches known ad segments to reduce repeated playback disruption

`Ads Blocked` tracks confirmed worker-side playlist ad detections plus a few page-side fallback recoveries when Twitch injects direct media or explicit player-shell ads. `DOM Ads Blocked` tracks separate player-side cleanup events such as overlays, display shells, and popup removal. Both counters persist through the background worker using page-scoped media keys so live routes and `/videos/<id>` playback stay aligned without adding extra DOM scans or observers.

During active ad recovery, Twitch may temporarily fall back to a lower-quality backup stream, such as `360p`, while the extension keeps playback alive. Once the ad window ends and the player returns to native playback, your chosen quality is restored.

## What's New

### v5.1.3
- **Post-Ad Recovery Without Buffer Fix** - Fixed a regression where disabling the Buffer Fix toggle could leave live playback stuck on a loading spinner after ads because the post-ad recovery path stopped before it could resume or reload the player.
- **Ad-Recovery / Buffer-Fix Separation** - Kept the Buffer Fix toggle scoped to normal live-buffer interventions only, while preserving the dedicated post-ad resume and reload safety net so ad blocking still recovers cleanly when Twitch ends playback at ad exit.
- **Less Aggressive Buffer Fix** - Tightened live stall detection so the buffer fix no longer fires just because Twitch is intentionally running a low-buffer catch-up window with future data still available.
- **Safer Live-Edge Drift Correction** - Limited automatic live-edge seeks to cases where the media element still reports future-ready playback data, avoiding forced jumps during active rebuffers.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full version history.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run package:chrome
npm run lint
npm run knip
```

Load the unpacked extension from `dist/manifest.json` after `npm run build`.
Create a Chrome Web Store upload archive with `npm run package:chrome`; it writes `ttv-ab-<version>-chrome-store.zip` at the repo root.

`npm run knip` is expected to pass cleanly with the current `knip` 6.1.1 configuration.

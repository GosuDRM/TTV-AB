A lightweight browser extension that blocks Twitch ads on live streams and VODs while keeping playback stable.

## 📥 Install

> **⚠️ Supported browsers: Firefox and Chromium-based desktop browsers only.** TTV AB can't run on WebKit-based browsers like Orion, or on anything on iOS/iPadOS (every iOS browser is WebKit under the hood). The ad-blocker can't load there and the player goes to a black screen, so please use Firefox or a Chromium-based browser on a computer.

## ⚙️ How It Works

TTV AB intercepts Twitch's HLS video playlists at the network level. When Twitch injects ad-marked segments or forces the player onto an ad-only path, the extension:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/pipeline.svg" alt="Animated ad-blocking pipeline: the worker fetch hook inspects every Twitch playlist; clean playlists pass straight through to native playback, while ad breaks are stripped and bridged with a clean backup stream until native quality is restored." width="860">
</p>

- Strips ad segments from M3U8 media playlists in real time
- Fetches clean backup streams using alternative player types when the native stream is ad-locked
- Serves a valid empty video segment in place of blocked ad content to keep the decoder stable
- Monitors playback health and automatically recovers from stalls after ad breaks
- Restores your original quality and volume settings once native playback resumes

When a channel opens during an ad, or an ad starts mid-stream, the extension switches to a clean backup stream within a couple of seconds so video starts playing right away. The backup targets the quality your connection has been sustaining (even if the player had just restarted on a low rung when the ad hit), with a 360p floor so a channel-open preroll never starts blurrier than 360p while the player is still ramping up from its lowest quality. Your full native quality and audio are restored automatically and seamlessly once the ad window ends. The optional **Low Quality Fallback** toggle trades some quality for an even faster first frame, starting on a quick low-resolution stream and climbing back up as the break ends.

## 🔔 What's New

### v12.0.0 - 2026-07-09
- **Frozen video after ad breaks now recovers itself.** Hostile ad breaks no longer hop rapidly between backup streams (the churn that could freeze the video while audio keeps running), and a new post-break watchdog detects a frozen video and recovers it with a quick pause and play, or a player reload if needed.

### v11.0.4 - 2026-07-09
- **FrankerFaceZ front-page conflict fixed.** Featured broadcasters on the Twitch front page no longer start playing on their own after you switch tabs or windows; playback protection now runs only on pages where you opened a stream, so FFZ's front-page autoplay setting and manual pauses hold.

### v11.0.3 - 2026-07-04
- **Safer backup quality on weak connections.** In the rare moment the extension has no quality reading yet, the ad-break backup no longer jumps straight to the maximum resolution (which could stall slower connections); it starts at a safe resolution and climbs to your usual quality.

## 🛠️ Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GosuDRM/TTV-AB.git
cd TTV-AB
npm install
npm run build          # compiles TypeScript, minifies, and bundles
npm run package:chrome # creates Chrome Web Store upload archive
npm run lint           # runs Biome linter
npm run knip           # checks for unused exports
```

The build outputs to `dist/`. Load the unpacked extension from `dist/manifest.json` in your browser's developer mode after building.

The source tree under `src/` is organized by concern: `modules/` for core ad-blocking logic (processor, parser, player, hooks, worker, state, API), `scripts/` for the bridge and background service worker, and `popup/` for the extension UI.

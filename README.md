A lightweight browser extension that blocks Twitch ads on live streams and VODs while keeping playback stable.

## 📥 Install

> **⚠️ Supported browsers: Firefox 142 or newer and Chromium-based desktop browsers built on Chromium 111 or newer only.** TTV AB can't run on WebKit-based browsers like Orion, or on anything on iOS/iPadOS (every iOS browser is WebKit under the hood). The ad-blocker can't load there and the player goes to a black screen, so please use Firefox or a Chromium-based browser on a computer.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Blocks preroll and midroll ads on live streams and Twitch VODs
- ✅ Keeps a clean backup stream playing during ad breaks to reduce black screens, purple screens, and stalls
- ✅ Returns to native video quality and audio after recovery, including enhanced HEVC and AV1 qualities when available
- ✅ Keeps recovery working in background tabs and Picture-in-Picture
- ✅ Removes stale Twitch ad overlays after playback returns
- ✅ Independent, live-updating controls for Ad Blocking, Ad Spoofing, and Low Quality Fallback
- ✅ Optional Ad Spoofing to reduce anti-adblock detection
- ✅ Optional Low Quality Fallback for faster recovery; disabling it prioritizes normal-quality sources, with a temporary clean low-quality bridge available during prerolls and midrolls
- ✅ Optional Ad Break Timer in the stream's top-right corner, disabled by default
- ✅ Optional Turbo Mode that pauses new statistics and achievements while preserving existing history and all ad-blocking controls
- ✅ Persistent, live-updating Ads Blocked and Time Saved totals
- ✅ Statistics dashboard with a 7-day chart, detailed per-channel history, JSON export, reset, and **12 Achievement Badges**
- ✅ Language selector, with 12 languages supported (EN, ES, FR, DE, PT, IT, JA, KO, ZH-CN, ZH-TW, RU, UK)
- ✅ Built-in Generate Log tool that creates a local, privacy-filtered diagnostic file for bug reports
- ✅ Accessible Manifest V3 popup with Retro and Neon themes
- ✅ Supports Firefox and Chromium-based desktop browsers

## 🚀 Usage

1. Install the extension from your browser's add-on store
2. Navigate to [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) and open any live stream or VOD
3. Ads are blocked automatically, no configuration needed
4. Click the extension icon to view stats or toggle Ad Blocking, Ad Spoofing, Low Quality Fallback, and Ad Break Timer
5. Change language via the dropdown in the popup footer

## ⚙️ How It Works

TTV AB checks Twitch's HLS playlists before playback and blocks recognized client-side ad requests on VODs.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/pipeline.svg" alt="Animated ad-blocking pipeline: the Twitch player worker passes clean playlists through unchanged, rejects ad-marked media, keeps a verified clean backup live, and restores native playback only after repeated clean checks." width="860">
</p>

- Checks alternative Twitch sources one at a time, using a fresh clean native playlist or a compatible silent hold while searching
- Plays only verified, playable, ad-free backups, refreshes them during the break, and rotates stalled sources
- Continues each switch between sources, including the return to native, from the point the live stream reached, so playback does not jump back
- Returns to native playback after repeated clean checks for the same stream and break, then restores quality and audio settings
- Keeps recovery tied to the current player across background tabs and Picture-in-Picture, respecting explicit pauses

**Low Quality Fallback** is on by default, allowing a clean 360p bridge sooner while higher-quality sources are checked. Turning it off prioritizes normal-quality sources; prerolls and midrolls may still use a temporary clean low-quality bridge if those sources fail. Other sources may still offer lower qualities.

**Ad Spoofing** sends Twitch progress and completion signals for blocked ads and, outside midrolls, requests the blocked ad's segments in the background. Turning it off stops both and leaves ad blocking active.

The optional **Ad Break Timer** is off by default and can be switched on in the popup. It tracks the current break until it ends; it does not predict when your selected quality will return.

## 🔔 What's New

### v25.0.3 - 2026-10-26

- **Client-Side Ad Diagnostics** - Record in debug logs when Twitch announces or requests an ad that plays as a separate video beside the stream, and when an unrecognized video starts playing next to it, so any change in how Twitch delivers these ads shows up in logs. ([#98](https://github.com/GosuDRM/TTV-AB/issues/98))

### v25.0.2 - 2026-10-26

- **Streams Already Playing When You Install** - Restart the player once, without refreshing the tab, so ads are blocked on a stream that was already playing when you installed the extension. In Chrome, the extension now also starts in Twitch tabs that were already open. If the restart does not take effect, the refresh prompt still appears.
- **Welcome Message in Background Tabs** - Show the welcome message once the Twitch tab is visible, instead of showing and hiding it while you were on another tab.
- **Generate Log in Long Sessions** - Keep the error and ad break entries saved from trimmed history in Generate Log, instead of dropping them once a long session filled the log.
- **Repeated Player Errors** - Save a diagnostic snapshot when a player error adds new details, instead of on every repeat of the same error.
- **Generate Log During Ad Recovery** - Keep a tab's playback details in Generate Log when its post-ad recovery details cannot be read, instead of leaving all of them out.
- **Ad Break Buffering Diagnostics** - Record in debug logs how often and when the stream buffers during each ad break and while it returns to the stream, to help track down buffering during some ad breaks.

### v25.0.1 - 2026-10-24

- **Player Stopping After Some Ad Breaks** - Accept the stream when Twitch renumbers it after an ad break, instead of rejecting it until the player stopped with a network error. ([#96](https://github.com/GosuDRM/TTV-AB/issues/96))
- **Black Screen Diagnostics** - Record in debug logs when the stream's timing runs ahead of your clock, to help track down a black screen during some ad breaks.

## 🛠️ Development

Use the `main` branch for Chrome or `firefox` for Firefox. With Node.js 22 and Python 3 installed, `npm ci` installs dependencies and `npm run build` creates `dist/` and the browser packages.

Edit the TypeScript source, never `dist/`:

- `src/modules/`: stream handling, ad blocking, and playback recovery
- `src/scripts/`: background script and page bridge
- `src/popup/`: popup, themes, and translations
- `tests/`: regression tests

Tests read `dist/`, so build before running the checks:

```sh
npm run build && npm test && npm run test:shuffle && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run knip
```

To try a build, [load `dist/` unpacked](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) in Chrome, or [load `dist/manifest.json` as a temporary add-on](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/) in Firefox. After each rebuild, reload the extension and refresh the Twitch tab.

Keep pull requests focused, add a regression test for each bug fix, check playback changes on Twitch, and list what you tested and what you could not.

<details>
<summary>Build and release notes</summary>

- **Firefox popup files:** The `firefox` branch tracks compiled `src/popup/popup.js` and `translations.js`. If the build reports them out of sync, copy both from `dist/src/popup/` and rebuild.
- **Packages:** The manifest decides which archives the build creates. Packaging errors stop the build.
- **Releases:** Annotated release tags include `Firefox-Commit: <full SHA>`, and the release workflow builds Firefox from that commit.

## 💬 Support

- Found a bug? [Open an issue](https://github.com/GosuDRM/TTV-AB/issues)
- For playback repeats or gaps, use **Generate Log** in the affected tab after the issue occurs. `[Continuity]` entries record accepted transitions, rejected windows, and timestamp gaps or overlaps, with numbered sources instead of signed URLs. Repeated matching events are summarized at most once every five seconds. These playlist timestamps do not prove what was played or whether audio stayed in sync; include when you noticed the issue.

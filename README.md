## ⚙️ How It Works

TTV AB intercepts Twitch's HLS video playlists at the network level. When Twitch injects ad-marked segments or forces the player onto an ad-only path, the extension:

- Strips ad segments from M3U8 media playlists in real time
- Fetches clean backup streams using alternative player types when the native stream is ad-locked
- Serves a valid empty video segment in place of blocked ad content to keep the decoder stable
- Monitors playback health and automatically recovers from stalls after ad breaks
- Restores your original quality and volume settings once native playback resumes

During ad recovery, Twitch may briefly serve a lower-quality backup stream (e.g. 360p) while the extension keeps playback alive. Your chosen quality is restored automatically once the ad window ends.

- **Ad spoofing off by default** — GQL ad-completion beacons no longer fire unless user enables

### v8.5.2 — 2026-05-19
- **Ad-end false positive fix** — 8s minimum ad duration prevents premature reload loop during midroll pods

### v8.5.1 — 2026-05-19
- **CSAI fast path fix** — backup now preloads in parallel to prevent loading-circle stall

### v8.5.0 — 2026-05-19

- **Navigation ad leak fix** — worker cleans up old channel's cached backups on navigation; stale in-flight fetches rejected

### v8.4.6 — 2026-05-18
- **DATERANGE catch-all** — `twitch-` CLASS prefix replaces explicit checks, covering future ad marker formats

### v8.4.5 — 2026-05-18
- CSAI sticky flag cleared when playlist has no ads, empty strip falls through to backup search

### v8.4.4 — 2026-05-18

## 🛠️ Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GosuDRM/TTV-AB.git
cd TTV-AB
npm install
npm run build          # compiles TypeScript, minifies, and bundles
npm run package:chrome # creates Chrome Web Store upload archive
npm run lint           # runs Biome linter
npm run knip           # checks for unused exports
```

The build outputs to `dist/`. Load the unpacked extension from `dist/manifest.json` in your browser's developer mode after building.

The source tree under `src/` is organized by concern — `modules/` for core ad-blocking logic (processor, parser, player, hooks, worker, state, API), `scripts/` for the bridge and background service worker, and `popup/` for the extension UI.

## 📖 Usage

1. Navigate to [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv)
2. Open any live stream
3. Ads will be automatically blocked
4. Click the extension icon and use the toggle to enable/disable
5. Change language via the dropdown in the footer

## ⚙️ How It Works

The extension intercepts Twitch's HLS video playlists and:
- Strips ad segments from M3U8 playlists
- Fetches backup ad-free streams when ads are detected
- Caches ad segments to prevent playback

## ✨ What's New

### v4.2.1
- **Playback Token Parity** - Playback token requests now mirror Twitch page traffic more closely by forwarding session and language headers while only sending integrity headers when available.
- **Backup Retry Reduction** - Backup player types that already fail to return a usable token, or already return ad-marked playlists, are now skipped on later retries during the same ad cycle.
- **Worker Fetch Hardening** - Worker request handling now supports Request objects, preserves response metadata, and keeps ad-segment replacement behavior consistent across playlist fetch paths.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full version history.

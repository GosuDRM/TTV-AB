A lightweight browser extension that blocks Twitch ads on live streams and VODs while keeping playback stable.

## 📥 Install

> **⚠️ Supported browsers: Firefox 142 or newer and Chromium-based desktop browsers built on Chromium 111 or newer only.** TTV AB can't run on WebKit-based browsers like Orion, or on anything on iOS/iPadOS (every iOS browser is WebKit under the hood). The ad-blocker can't load there and the player goes to a black screen, so please use Firefox or a Chromium-based browser on a computer.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Blocks preroll and midroll ads on live streams and Twitch VODs
- ✅ Keeps a clean backup stream playing during ad breaks to reduce black screens, purple screens, and stalls
- ✅ Returns to native video quality and audio after recovery, including enhanced HEVC and AV1 qualities when available
- ✅ Keeps recovery working in background tabs and Picture-in-Picture
- ✅ Removes stale Twitch ad overlays after playback returns
- ✅ Independent, live-updating controls for Ad Blocking, Ad Spoofing, and Low Quality Fallback
- ✅ Optional Ad Spoofing to reduce anti-adblock detection
- ✅ Optional Low Quality Fallback for faster recovery; disabling it prioritizes normal-quality sources, with a temporary clean low-quality bridge available during prerolls and midrolls
- ✅ Optional Ad Break Timer in the stream's top-right corner, disabled by default
- ✅ Optional Turbo Mode that pauses new statistics and achievements while preserving existing history and all ad-blocking controls
- ✅ Persistent, live-updating Ads Blocked and Time Saved totals
- ✅ Statistics dashboard with a 7-day chart, detailed per-channel history, JSON export, reset, and **12 Achievement Badges**
- ✅ Language selector, with 12 languages supported (EN, ES, FR, DE, PT, IT, JA, KO, ZH-CN, ZH-TW, RU, UK)
- ✅ Built-in Generate Log tool that creates a local, privacy-filtered diagnostic file for bug reports
- ✅ Accessible Manifest V3 popup with Retro and Neon themes
- ✅ Supports Firefox and Chromium-based desktop browsers

## 🚀 Usage

1. Install the extension from your browser's add-on store
2. Navigate to [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) and open any live stream or VOD
3. Ads are blocked automatically, no configuration needed
4. Click the extension icon to view stats or toggle Ad Blocking, Ad Spoofing, Low Quality Fallback, and Ad Break Timer
5. Change language via the dropdown in the popup footer

## ⚙️ How It Works

TTV AB checks Twitch's HLS playlists before playback and blocks recognized client-side ad requests on VODs.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/pipeline.svg" alt="Animated ad-blocking pipeline: the Twitch player worker passes clean playlists through unchanged, rejects ad-marked media, keeps a verified clean backup live, and restores native playback only after repeated clean checks." width="860">
</p>

- Checks alternative Twitch sources one at a time, using a fresh clean native playlist or a compatible silent hold while searching
- Plays only verified, playable, ad-free backups, refreshes them during the break, and rotates stalled sources
- Continues each switch between sources, including the return to native, from the point the live stream reached, so playback does not jump back
- Returns to native playback after repeated clean checks for the same stream and break, then restores quality and audio settings
- Keeps recovery tied to the current player across background tabs and Picture-in-Picture, respecting explicit pauses

**Low Quality Fallback** is on by default, allowing a clean 360p bridge sooner while higher-quality sources are checked. Turning it off prioritizes normal-quality sources; prerolls and midrolls may still use a temporary clean low-quality bridge if those sources fail. Other sources may still offer lower qualities.

**Ad Spoofing** sends Twitch progress and completion signals for blocked ads and, outside midrolls, requests the blocked ad's segments in the background. Turning it off stops both and leaves ad blocking active.

The optional **Ad Break Timer** is off by default and can be switched on in the popup. It tracks the current break until it ends; it does not predict when your selected quality will return.

## 🔔 What's New

### v26.0.0 - 2026-10-29

- **Video Ads Beside the Stream** - Keep a blocked video ad beside the stream hidden and muted while the stream player is briefly unavailable, such as during a player restart, instead of showing it with sound for a moment and counting it twice.
- **Generate Log for Frozen Tabs in Firefox** - Include a frozen Twitch tab's last saved debug log details when you opened the channel from elsewhere on Twitch, instead of leaving its section empty.
- **Ad Break Timer After the Ads End** - Hide the Ad Break Timer once the ads in a break are over, instead of counting for as long as the ad-free replacement stream is kept, and show it again if more ads arrive in the same break.
- **Blocked Ad Count Updates** - Update the blocked ad count and toolbar badge right after an ad is blocked, instead of up to 5 seconds later when watch time was being saved at the same moment.
- **Ad Spoofing for Extra Ad Markers** - Keep skipping ad markers beyond an ad break's declared ad count, instead of reporting them on the next playlist update.
- **Player Updates After a Failed Message** - Keep sending ad blocking updates to the player after one update cannot be delivered, instead of stopping all later updates until the player restarts.
- **Saving Statistics Under Load** - Keep confirming saved statistics while the extension is busy, instead of rechecking them on every later save for up to 3 days.
- **Ad Progress in Long Sessions** - Keep ad progress for at most 32 streams, so long sessions with many banner and preview players stop accumulating it.
- **Debug Log Snapshots During Ad Recovery** - Save a snapshot only when post-ad recovery moves to a new step and include that step's log line, instead of saving repeated snapshots without the newest line.
- **Restart Message for Streams Already Playing** - Record in debug logs whether the one-time player restart for a stream that was already playing was accepted, instead of always reporting a restart.
- **Stream Return Diagnostics** - Record in debug logs why the stream stays on the ad-free replacement after an ad break, to help track down breaks where returning to the stream takes several minutes.
- **Less Work on Twitch Pages** - Look up the stream player less often: not when the stream's own video starts playing or changes volume, and once instead of twice per playback check.

### v25.0.4 - 2026-10-26

- **Client-Side Ad Request Details** - Record in debug logs the format of each client-side ad request, whether it came from the home page, and whether Twitch's ad server answered or the request was stopped first.

### v25.0.3 - 2026-10-26

- **Client-Side Ad Diagnostics** - Record in debug logs when Twitch announces or requests an ad that plays as a separate video beside the stream, and when an unrecognized video starts playing next to it, so any change in how Twitch delivers these ads shows up in logs.

## 🛠️ Development

Use the `main` branch for Chrome or `firefox` for Firefox. With Node.js 22 and Python 3 installed, `npm ci` installs dependencies and `npm run build` creates `dist/` and the browser packages.

Edit the TypeScript source, never `dist/`:

- `src/modules/`: stream handling, ad blocking, and playback recovery
- `src/scripts/`: background script and page bridge
- `src/popup/`: popup, themes, and translations
- `tests/`: regression tests

Tests read `dist/`, so build before running the checks:

```sh
npm run build && npm test && npm run test:shuffle && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run knip
```

To try a build, [load `dist/` unpacked](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) in Chrome, or [load `dist/manifest.json` as a temporary add-on](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/) in Firefox. After each rebuild, reload the extension and refresh the Twitch tab.

Keep pull requests focused, add a regression test for each bug fix, check playback changes on Twitch, and list what you tested and what you could not.

<details>
<summary>Build and release notes</summary>

- **Firefox popup files:** The `firefox` branch tracks compiled `src/popup/popup.js` and `translations.js`. If the build reports them out of sync, copy both from `dist/src/popup/` and rebuild.
- **Packages:** The manifest decides which archives the build creates. Packaging errors stop the build.
- **Releases:** Annotated release tags include `Firefox-Commit: <full SHA>`, and the release workflow builds Firefox from that commit.

## 💬 Support

- Found a bug? [Open an issue](https://github.com/GosuDRM/TTV-AB/issues)
- For playback repeats or gaps, use **Generate Log** in the affected tab after the issue occurs. `[Continuity]` entries record accepted transitions, rejected windows, and timestamp gaps or overlaps, with numbered sources instead of signed URLs. Repeated matching events are summarized at most once every five seconds. These playlist timestamps do not prove what was played or whether audio stayed in sync; include when you noticed the issue.

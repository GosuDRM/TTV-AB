## ⚙️ How It Works

TTV AB intercepts Twitch's HLS video playlists at the network level. When Twitch injects ad-marked segments or forces the player onto an ad-only path, the extension:

- Strips ad segments from M3U8 media playlists in real time
- Fetches clean backup streams using alternative player types when the native stream is ad-locked
- Serves a valid empty video segment in place of blocked ad content to keep the decoder stable
- Monitors playback health and automatically recovers from stalls after ad breaks
- Restores your original quality and volume settings once native playback resumes

When a channel opens during an ad — or an ad starts mid-stream — the extension switches to a clean lower-quality backup (e.g. 360p) within a couple of seconds so video starts right away, then upgrades to your chosen quality automatically and seamlessly once the ad window ends.

## 🔔 What's New

### v9.3.3 — 2026-06-07
- **Long ad sessions end faster.** The native-recovery loop now caps the wait at ~24s (6 failed probes) when Twitch keeps ad-marking every probe, instead of running for the full 90s.
- **Less probing during a clean-pinned hold.** Backup cache windows raised to 15s/20s so the ~4s playlist poll no longer triggers a fresh backup search on every tick.
- **Quieter trace logs.** Per-cycle `Cooling down` and `Whitelisted variants` lines deduped.
- **Stuck pinned backup detected and switched within ~3s.** A new playhead-watcher samples the video element every 1.5s; if the pinned backup's buffer stops growing for 3s (Twitch's "Playhead stalling" condition), the watcher forces a fresh backup search via a new bridge message. The previous 15s cache window hid this stall for its full duration.
- **No more runaway re-search loops on broken streams.** Force-refresh is capped at 3 attempts per pinned type. When exhausted, a one-time warning is logged and the watcher goes silent — no worker load, no log spam when Twitch has no clean fallback to offer.

## 🛠️ Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GosuDRM/TTV-AB.git
cd TTV-AB
npm install
npm run build          # compiles TypeScript, minifies, and bundles
npm run package:chrome # creates Chrome Web Store upload archive
npm run lint           # runs Biome linter
npm run knip           # checks for unused exports
```

The build outputs to `dist/`. Load the unpacked extension from `dist/manifest.json` in your browser's developer mode after building.

The source tree under `src/` is organized by concern — `modules/` for core ad-blocking logic (processor, parser, player, hooks, worker, state, API), `scripts/` for the bridge and background service worker, and `popup/` for the extension UI.
